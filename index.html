                <p>My name is Alex and I'm a student of the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp. I have no previous coding experience, but I am glad to be here. Currently I work at Aetna doing pharmacy insurance. Welcome to my portfolio here you can view all of my projects as well as information on how to contact me. For fun I really like watching anime and playing video games. My favorite games included DotA 2, WoW, and Tetris.
                </p>
                <p>Welcome to my porfolio. Here you will find links to my previous coding projects as well as ways to get in contact with me. I am on track to be a full stack developer. I strive to learn and better myself everyday. So contact me with some projects to work on! One day I want to be proficient enough with coding do create my own game on the app store; however, this bootcamp doesn't teach me the programs necessary for that, but it will give me the basic knowledge to learn any language I want in the future. This next paragraph below is just filler words.</p>
