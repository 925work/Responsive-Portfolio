                <p>My name is Alex and I'm a student of the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp. I have had no previous coding experience prior to this class, but I am glad to be here. Currently I work at Aetna doing pharmacy insurance. I am here looking for a career change while challenging myself by learning new skills along the way. I am loving the program so far. I have met many cool people and I am excited to see how much I will grow by the end.
                </p>
                <p>Welcome to my porfolio. Here you will find links to my previous coding projects as well as ways to get in contact with me. I am on track to be a full stack developer. I strive to learn and better myself everyday. So contact me with some projects to work on! One day I want to be proficient enough with coding do create my own game on the app store; however, this bootcamp doesn't teach me the programs necessary for that, but it will give me the basic knowledge to learn any language I want in the future.</p>
                <p> My interests include playing video games, watching TV shows, and cars. I also enjoy indoor rock climbing, mostly bouldering. Eventually, I want to buy a van and live in it. I want to travel the country and climb all accross the nation! I would be very happy with a remote position that will allow me to do that.</p>
